# Plug & Play Contracts

## Introduction

Developers spend a lot of valuable time and resources reinventing the wheel when it comes to building smart contracts and ensuring they are secure and reliable. Furthermore, due to lack of auditing and security expertise within organizations, there is high risk associated with smart contract exploitation.

By providing more simplicity around smart contract integrations, we believe this solution will drive developer adoption, ensure ecosystem growth and improve the overall security of Dapps running on Cardano.

Maestro and Anastasia Labs collaborated to offer developers a smart contract-as-a-service platform to deploy and interact with open-sourced smart contracts with ease, addressing the key challenges when building Dapps on Cardano

This project is funded by the Cardano Treasury in [Catalyst Fund 10](https://projectcatalyst.io/funds/10/f10-developer-ecosystem-the-evolution/plug-and-play-smart-contract-api-a-game-changing-platform-to-deploy-open-source-contracts-instantly).

## Details

Below contracts have been identified to provide great benefits to the dev community, enhancing the interaction within Maestro's platform:

1. Single Asset Staking Contracts: These contracts enable users to collectively stake their digital assets and fairly distribute rewards among participants.
2. Linear Vesting Contracts: Our secure linear vesting contracts offer customization options, providing a reliable mechanism for releasing assets gradually over a specified timeframe.
3. Direct Offer: Our contract facilitates peer-to-peer trading of assets through the Direct Offer feature.
